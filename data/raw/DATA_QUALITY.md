## Data Sources

This dataset combines targets from two sources with different discovery methods:

### Hyperforin (CHEMBL464)
- **Source:** Literature curation (peer-reviewed publications)
- **Target Count:** 14
- **Method:** Manual curation of validated pharmacological targets
- **Rationale:** ChEMBL contains 148 activities for Hyperforin, but none are standard IC50/Ki binding assays at therapeutic concentrations. Available assays are primarily in vivo toxicity studies and functional effects.
- **Coverage:** High-confidence, clinically important targets (PXR, TRPC6, CYP enzymes, drug transporters, etc.)
- **Limitation:** May miss obscure or unpublished targets (publication bias)

### Quercetin (CHEMBL50)
- **Source:** ChEMBL API (automated extraction)
- **Target Count:** 122
- **Method:** IC50/Ki ≤ 10 µM filter on ChEMBL database
- **Coverage:** Broad, includes high-throughput screening results
- **Limitation:** May include false positives from single-point assays

---

## Methodological Asymmetry

**This is a documented limitation in natural product pharmacology.**

The difference in discovery methods reflects **data availability**, not biological differences:
- Complex phytochemicals (Hyperforin) → functional assays, clinical studies
- Screening compounds (Quercetin) → standardized IC50 binding assays

## Quality Metrics

| Compound | Targets | Source Type | Validation Level | False Positive Risk |
|----------|---------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Hyperforin | 14 | Literature | High (peer-reviewed) | Low |
| Quercetin | 122 | ChEMBL HTS | Medium (single assays) | Medium |

## Bias Mitigation

To ensure robust conclusions despite methodological asymmetry:

1. **Source Tracking:** All records include `source` field (`ChEMBL_API` vs `Literature_[Citation]`)

2. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Bootstrap sampling validates that network metrics are robust to target count differences (see `scripts/sensitivity_analysis.py`)

3. **Statistical Controls:** Network analysis uses degree-preserving null models that account for target count asymmetry

4. **Transparent Reporting:** This limitation is documented in all outputs and publications

## Recommendations for Analysis

### ✅ Valid Uses
- Network proximity/separation metrics (relative distances)
- Permutation-based significance testing
- Mechanistic hypothesis generation

### ⚠️ Use with Caution
- Direct comparison of target counts between compounds
- Claiming "Hyperforin is more selective than Quercetin"
- Topology metrics without degree normalization

### ❌ Invalid Uses
- Absolute target count as selectivity measure
- Raw proximity scores without null model comparison
